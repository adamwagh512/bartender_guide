2. Tech Badges - I obtained the tech badges at the top of this README from Ileriayo. The link to that repository is [here](https://github.com/Ileriayo/markdown-badges)

3. Neon Signs - I took the code for the neon signs from [codepen.io](codepen.io). I want to thank [Thomas Trinca](https://codepen.io/Trinca) and [Kevin Ogden](https://codepen.io/KevinOgden) for making their work available to other developers. I hope to return the favor some day.

4.  Finally, I would like to acknowledge [Aaron Anglin](https://github.com/aanglin) for his many contributions to this project. He showed me the Cocktail DB API, and was an invaluable sounding board during the design, building and debugging phases of this project. Thank you Aaron!
